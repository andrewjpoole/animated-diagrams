## Features
- Draw diagrams with your own style and handwriting
- Import and export SVG files
- Easily reorder paths
- Animation your diagram as if you were drawing it in real time
- Set pauses or change the drawing speed so you can talk/present while the diagram draws itself

    with optional thumbnail at the start so when exporting slides you see the final rendered diagram.
